# Data Structures Library

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures using both array-based and linked list-based approaches in Java. The primary aim is to provide clear examples of how each data structure can be implemented and used.

## Contents

- `MyArrayStack`: A stack implementation using dynamic arrays.
- `MyLinkedListStack`: A stack implementation using doubly linked lists.
- `MyArrayQueue`: A queue implementation using dynamic arrays.
- `MyLinkedListQueue`: A queue implementation using doubly linked lists.
- `MyArrayMinHeap`: A min-heap implementation using dynamic arrays.
- `MyLinkedListMinHeap`: A min-heap implementation using doubly linked lists.

## Features

- **Stack**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure with operations for pushing, popping, and peeking.
- **Queue**: First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure with operations for enqueueing, dequeueing, and peeking.
- **Min Heap**: A complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes, optimized for easy retrieval of the smallest element.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher
